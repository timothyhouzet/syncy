# Syncy (Experimental)

This is an attempt to create a simple rsync GUI using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).

### Requirements

Tested on macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6

### Installation

[Download](https://github.com/timothyhouzet/syncy/archive/master.zip) and unzip the project to your project folder, cd to that folder in the command line and run `npm install && npm start`

## Build

To build the app *(only tested on macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6)*, cd to the project folder and run `npx electron-forge make`. This will package and build the application and put it inside the `{your_project_name}/out/` folder. See the [Electron CLI](https://electronforge.io/cli) docs for more information.

## Notes

This is still a work in progress and was built for personal use. 

Use it at your own risk :-)
