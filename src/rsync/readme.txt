The rsync is compiled with prefix $HOME directory. Make a directory $HOME/rsync and extract the contents of the .dmg folder into  $HOME/rsync.

The directory structure is:

$HOME/rsync/bin
$HOME/rsync/share/man/man1
$HOME/rsync/share/man/man5

Three files, the binary rsync and the two man files rsync.1 and rsyncd.conf.5. The binary is compiled as a 64-bit executable.

After install point RsyncOSX to use $HOME/rsync/bin as path to rsync. As an example my directory is :

/Volumes/Home/thomas/rsync/bin

which is set in RsyncOSX configuration.
